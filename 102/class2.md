*Little cheat sheet*

pwd --> print work directory
this command shows where you are now

ls --> list
this command shows you a list of whats in the directory that you are currently in

cd --> change directory
this command takes you to a new directory of your choice or if used with no location it will take you to the home directory

You can use the `TAB` key to autofill command paths and save some time

You can use the `UP` and `DOWN` keys to scroll through a history of commands and save some time
