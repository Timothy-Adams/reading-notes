**Git is the Bees Knees?**

Git is a DVCS or Distributed Version Control System

Git creates snapshots of files and stores reference to it

Git relies on local opeerations

Git tracks every change applied to any file or directory

Git is set up to minimize the possibility of losing or permanently damaging files

Files in Git reside in three main states: committed, modified, and staged

ACP--> Add Commit Push

`git add (file name)` or `(. to add all)`
`git commit -m "why you made changes"`
`git push origin main`

`git status` gives the status between your local and the main
`git clone "link"` lets you clone down from the main to a local drive
`git pull` pulls updates from the file origin in GitHub

A "gituation" is a problem that arises when changes are made in GitHub and on the remote drive separately and then you try to commit from local or pull from the main.
